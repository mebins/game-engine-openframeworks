# game-engine-openframeworks

This is my game engine project which was developed part of my game engine architecture course at SJSU.
To run this program, one must first use the application generator bundled with openFrameworks and then replace the src and bin files in the application directory generated.
Then you can simply run it through the IDE such as Visual Studio or Xcode. 

In this project includes: 
an Octree for spatial partitioning
Particle System
Physics System
Emitting System
Controls
Multiple Cameras
and also the scene used for "Taxiship, the Taxicab Spaceship"
